NOOBS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS starting from a Windows machine:

1. Insert a micro SD card that is 8GB or greater in size into USB port of your computer.
2. Format the SD card using the platform-specific instructions below:
	Download the SD Association's Formatting Tool https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_windows/
	Install and run the Formatting Tool on your machine
	Set "FORMAT SIZE ADJUSTMENT" option to "ON" in the "Options" menu
	Check that the SD card you inserted matches the one selected by the Tool
	Click the "Format" button
3. Download  https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/
	Extract zip file.
	Copy the extracted files onto the root directory of SD card 
	Insert the SD card into your Pi and connect the power supply.
	Your Pi will now boot into NOOBS and install Debian (Rasperian).

If you are still having difficulties after following these instructions, then please visit 
the Raspberry Pi Forums ( http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/ ) for support.

4. Set up OS
	Set preferences / Mouse and Keyboard settings / US / english(US)
	Setup Wifi (symbol in upper right hand corner of screen.
	Download pigpio library from http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/
	install pigpio library to use both the SPI0 and SPI1 ports
		
	cd PIGPIO
	make
	sudo make install  
!!!-->	sudo chmod a+w /var/run/pigpio.pid              (otherwise, gpio will not init.) 

5. Enable SPI and check /boot/overlays/README disable spi0 hardware chipselects
 (www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md) 

	sudo nano /boot/config.txt    uncomment (remove #) on 
	dtparam=spi=on  				# enable SPI0
	dtoverlay=spi1-3cs,cs0_pin=18,cs1_pin=17	# enable SPI1

	

	##### dtoverlay=spi1-3cs,cs0_pin=gpio16,cs1_pin=gpio26,cs2_pin=gpio13 # enable SPI1 & set CS pins
	170907 - I oculd not get this to work, so modify the PCB.
	RLY_1 moved from p1-11 to p1-7 (gpio17->gpio04)
	RLY_2 moved from pp1-12 -> p1-15 (gpio18->gpio27)

6. Serial port   https://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/
6.1 Continue editing /boot/config.txt to enable the serial port
	enable_uart=1		# enable /dev/ttyS0 (/dev/serial0 is alias)
6.2 Disable the Console from using the uart - we need to use it for the vacuum gage.
	$ sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
	$ sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service

6.3 Remove the console from the cmdline.txt - it defaults to 9600 baud. If you edit this with:
	$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

	you will see something like:
	dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes root wait

	remove the line: console=serial0,115200 and save and reboot for changes to take effect.

6.4 Clone github repository. www.github.com  user=transmute-inc, pass=proton2018
	download zip file and create projects directory
	git config --global user.name "kim hailey"		# or Bob	
	git config --global user.email "kimh@transmute.com"	# your email
	git config --global core.editor leafpad

	cd projects
	git init

7. Clone a backup of the SD disk using the SD card copier accessory. 
Be sure to check "New Partition UUIDs" so you can mount the copied sd card. 
SD disks must have different UUIDs to be mounted concurrently on the same system.

Current status of 32G micro SD cards (180410)
	#5  32g debian 2.4.5 clone of #6 for Chris

	#1  32g debian 2.7.0 180608 for rpi 3B to Chris
	#2  debian 170925  steps 1-6.4 copied to Bob
	#3  32g free
	#4  32g clone of #6 180409
	
	#6  8g Last good 2.4.5 rpi3 before noobs 2.7.0 download 180409
	#7  8g 2.7.0 clone of #A
	#8  8g free
	#9  8G fat32 xfer drive

	#A  16g 2.7.0 180410 Kim	# os is 4.4g, but 8g is not quite big enough
	#B  16g 2.7.0 180410 Bob	# 32g takes too long to image, so 16g is just right!
	#C  16g backup of #A
	
8. Update the OS		# www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade	# upgrade all installed packages
	df -h				# check on space left sd card
	sudo apt-get clean		# remove install files to free up space
	

9. Text editors can be run from command window.
	leafpad  		# like notepad, default on file browser
	nano			# quick and dirty 
	vi			# (Vim 8.0)    


8. Link to dropbox uploader 	# work in progress - I do not have this working yet.
